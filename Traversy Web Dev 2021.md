# Web Development In 2021 - A Practical Guide

## HTML and CSS

- HTML 5 Page Structure and Semantic Tags
- Basic CSS Styling
- Positioning
- Alignment (Flexbos and CSS Grid)
- Transitions and Animation
- Responsive Design and Media Queries

---

## Sass

- preprocessor that is recommended for frontend developers
  - variables, mixins, functions, nesting, etc.

---

## CSS / UI Frameworks (Choose one)

<u>Tailwind CSS</u> - Utility-first framework

<u>Bootstrap</u> - Popular framework (Bootstrap 5 released)

<u>Materialize</u> - based on Material Design

<u>Bulma</u> - Modular and lightweight

---

## Learn Basic UI Design Principles

<u>Color and Contrast</u> - make sure text is readable

<u>White space</u> - spacing between elements

<u>Scale</u> - sizing relative to other elements

<u>Visual Hierarchy</u> - arrange in order of importance

<u>Typography</u> - text typefaces, sizing, etc.

---

---

## JavaScript

<u>Basics</u> - Variables, arrays, functions, etc.

<u>DOM and Styling</u> - Selecting and manipulating elements (ex. clicking a button that will remove a node in the DOM without reloading the page)

<u>Array Methods</u> - foreach, map, filter, reduce, etc.

<u>JSON</u> - JavaScript Object Notation, a way to send and store data

<u>HTTP Requests</u> - Fetch API, GET, POST, PUT, DELETE

---

## Other Tools

<u>Version Control</u> - Git, Subversion

<u>Repo Manage</u>r - GitHub, Bitbucket, GitLab

<u>Package Manager</u> - NPM, Yarn

<u>Module Bundler</u> - Parcel, Webpack, Rollup

<u>Browser Developer Tools</u> - Console, Network, Storage, etc.

<u>Editor Extensions and Helpers</u> - Linting, Prettier, Live Server, Emmet, Snippets, etc.

---

## Basic Frontend Deployment

Static Hosting - Netlify, GitHub Pages, Heroku

CPanel Hosting - InMotion, Hostgator, Bluehost

### Methods of Deploying

Git - Continuous deployment by pushing to a repo

FTP/SFTP - File Transfer Protocol (slow)
SSH - Secure Shell (terminal)

<u>Domain Names</u> - Namecheap, Google Domains, Enom

<u>Email Hosting</u> - Namecheap, Zoho Mail, CPanel

<u>SSL Certificates</u> - Let's Encrypt, Cloudflare, Namecheap

## The Foundations of a Frontend Developer

- set up a productive development environment
- write HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- use SASS and CSS framework
- can create responsive layouts
- build websites with some dynamic functionality and work with the DOM
- connect to 3rd party APIs with Fetch and understand basic HTTP
- use Git with Github or other version control system
- deploy and manage a website or small web app

---

## JavaScript Frameworks

- page loads with prebuilt JS from the framework that is inserted into a single page
  - allows you to have intricate web apps

React, Vue, Angular, Svelte

---

## TypeScript

- a superset of JS and is popular on its own as well as being paired with a FE framework
  - brings a "strict" type system to JavaScript
  - makes your code more robust and less prone to errors
  - object-oriented programming (classes, interfaces, generics, modules)
  - great for larger projects

---

## Testing

- helps prevent problems before they happen
  - Unit Tests - individual units like functions or classes
  - Integration tests - modules tested as a group (multiple functions, etc.)
  - End-to-End tests - test workflow from start to finish

---

## Server Side Rendering

You can also run frameworks like React and Vue on the server. 

- Next.js (React)
- Nuxt.js (Vue)
- Angular Universal (Angular)
- Sapper (Svelte)

---

## Static Site Generators

SSGs generate your website pages at build-time as opposed to real-time, making them super fast and secure

- Gatsby (React-based)
- Gridsome (Vue-based)
- 11ty (JS alternative to Jekyll)
- Jekyll (Ruby-based)
- Hugo (Go-based)

---

## Headless CMS

Backend-only content management system that is commonly used with static site generators

- Strapi
- Sanity.io
- Contentful
- Prismic
- Wordpress

---

## The Jamstack - JavaScript, APIs and Markup

Web architecture with high performance, security, and scalability at a low cost with a great dev experience

- static sites/assets
- Markdown
- Serverless
- Headless CMS for Content
- Hosting with services like Netlify

---

## Frontend Superstar

- build apps and interfaces with frontend framework
- work with component and global state
- connect to backend JSON data to integrate into your apps
- write and test clean and efficient code
- TypeScript
- Static site generators / Jamstack
- Server side rendering

---

## Algorithms

- FizzBuzz, string reversals, array chunking, palindromes, anagrams, max character, etc.

## Data Structures (Primitivite and Non-Primitive)

Arrays, Linked Lists, Queues, Stacks, etc.
